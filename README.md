Face Recognition
A recognition system can be used to detect a person present from its image in a video
frame. Since the face of a person is unique to himself/herself, it is a prime method to
provide security to an individual’s data and files of utmost importance. Face recognition
systems can be used for unlocking phones, forensic investigation, advertising, automatic
tagging on Facebook, etc.
A face recognition system attains its capability of uniquely identifying and verifying by
comparing and analyzing the facial contours of a person, which involves reading geometry
of the face and computing the distance between eye to forehead and forehead to chin with
the database.
In this project, the classifier used to detect faces is ensemble learning.Ensemble learning
is a technique in which multiple base learners (also known as a classifier or module) which
uses a different algorithm like Naïve Bayes, Logistic regression, Decision tree, SVM, KNN,
etc to obtain a strong classifier with high accuracy and precision that results into final
output or decision.
